==What is it?==

django-emailtemplates allows you to create and store a few e-mail templates in the database. 

Admins can edit them using django's admin (some support for the admin is included). 

If you want to send such e-mail, just fetch it from database and pass some parameters, like usernames or so. 

django-emailtemplates uses django templating system to render the e-mails; every e-mail is sent in both text and HTML.

django-emailtemplates includes some code that checks if the mail server is available - for tasks
where you *absolutley* need a working mailserver.

==Installation==

{{{
$ pip install svn+http://django-emailtemplates.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
}}}

==Small example==

===settings.py===
Add 'emailtemplates' to `INSTALLED_APPS`!

===view.py===

{{{

from emailtemplates.models import EmailTemplate
from emailtemplates.util import check_mail_server

...

def register_me(request):

    if check_mail_server(request):
    	EmailTemplate.get(uid = 'REGISTER_ME').send('foo@bar.pl', 'Foo Bar', message = 'Hey!')
	return "Message sent!"

    return "Message not sent, our mail server is not working :-("    	
}}}

==... but the code doesn't have this and that!===

I *really* want your feedback and patches. Help me with this project, please! :^)
